# Programming Language Foundations

Due to `coq`'s module and package manage mechanisms and the convenience of
scripting, I choose a different directory and file naming conventions
(CapitalCamelCase) from what's in the `logical-foundations`.

And `Imp` and its dependent contents are fully copied from `logical-foundations`
in `LF` directory.
